We will be able to observe the rituals of the various ash and vermilion covered Sadhus very closely. We will then visit  various monasteries in Nepal,  where we will get to learn about Buddhism from local monks. Being a city of mystical and spiritual practice, we will also look into our future, consulting a local astrologer who can chart our future.", "type_of_trip": 10}}, {"model": "package.trip", "pk": 35, "fields": {"title": "KATHMANDU LIVING", "starting_point": "KATHMANDU", "ending_point": "KATHMANDU", "price": 15000, "details": "Nepal has more to offer than just mountains. Its cultural heritage is equally rich, with astonishingly creative and unique architecture, and unique traditional practices. The ancient city of Kathmandu is a testament to its culturally rich heritage. Kathmandu has many different nicknames, some call it \u2018City of Woodcarving\u2019, some call it the \u2018Living Museum\u2019 and others call it the \u2018City of Temples\u2019. It used to be said that Kathmandu has more temples than houses, more gods than people, and within a 20km area there are seven World Heritage sites; Pashupatinath, Changu Narayan, Kathmandu Durbar Square, Boudhanath (largest Buddhist Stupa in South Asia), Patan Durbar Square, Bhaktapur Durbar Square and  Swayambhunath.  These sites were designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and are the highlights of the Kathmandu Valley. Though the city is a valley, the views of many Himalayan gems like Langtang and Ganesh can be clearly seen from here.", "type_of_trip": 10}}]
